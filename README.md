# POKEDEX âš¡ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¦

List of pokemons classified by types and statistics.

This challenge was also one of my first projects but this time I decided to create my first database using PostgreSQL. I used the Express framework and EJS as templating language.

This project allowed me to create my first SQL queries and to understand the MVC architecture.

## Features
- Route `/` : List of all pokemons in the database
- Route `/detail/:id` : Join tables pokemon, pokemon_type and type in order to display the name of the pokemon and its types
- Route `/types` : Display all types of pokemons so we can choose a pokemon acording to its type

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- Express
- EJS
- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- Dotenv
